### This repository contains a detailed 3D model and technical schematics of the Glock 17 9mm pistol, intended for educational and engineering reference purposes. Included in this project:

- Accurate 2D technical drawings with dimensions: **`SCHITE_2D.dwg`**

- Fully assembled 3D CAD model: **`ProdusFinal.dwg`**

- Measurements and tolerances based on real-world specs

- File formats: .DWG, .PDF

- To Do:
  - Refining the internal mechanism â€“ the internal components (e.g., slide, firing pin, recoil system) are already modeled, but the mechanism is not yet functional. Further work is needed to ensure proper alignment, movement, and interaction between parts.
  - Adding spiral rifling inside the barrel to provide the bullet with increased velocity and rotational stability upon firing
  - Testing tolerances and clearances for realistic assembly simulation
  - Optional: Simulate ballistic behavior using physics software (e.g., Fusion 360, SolidWorks Motion, or similar)
